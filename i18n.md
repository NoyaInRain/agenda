# i18n

* TODO translate to get a feel:
  * [x] Start page
  * [x] About page (interpolation happening there)
  * [ ] Meeting (loop and subelements, form)
  * server: email
  * server: data (user name, example meeting)
* TODO german translation via transifex (including scripts or whatever)

* OQ: how to design input for polyglot string? :)
* OQ: translation json files: where to branch tree (only pages? pages and sections?)

* notes:
  * time units seem to be international, if not we need formatDuration() helper later
  * plural: for json use all keys hack (foo, foo_plural, foo_0, foo_1, ...),
    start out only with foo and foo_plural until it gets translated to lang
    which needs more
